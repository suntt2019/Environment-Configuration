## About this repo

### What is this

A repo to record my experience of environment configurations.

### Why create this

It is easier to record the configuration of an environment after it has been completed, which in turn is useful for reconfiguring it later.

### Not working?

This repository is a record of experience in environment configuration and is not a configuration tutorial. There are bound to be a large number of situations that cannot be covered, so it is for reference only. For more information, see the relevant technical websites and configuration tutorials.

In addition, you are welcome to submit issues or pull requests to add to the list, although in general it is probably better to submit them at the official configuration tutorial
